### What is Crop Rotation?
Crop rotation is the practice of planting different crops sequentially on teh same plot of land to improve soil health, optimize nutrients in the soil and to combat pests and weeds.

In an ideal world we would all have a growing space that could be easily divided into equal and adequately sized areas where we could grow all the vegetables we would like, unfortunately for most people this is not the case.

The guidance and recommendations are given for an *ideal* environment but can be adjusted where required.

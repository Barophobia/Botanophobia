Due to the maturation time of different crops there will be times where you could have an empty space in your crop rotation as one or more have been harvested and you are waiting for another crop to mature in the group, this is where catch crops can be introduced to fill the temporary gap.

These crops may be from a different vegetable group to the one being grown previously but their pest and disease implications will be negligible as they are quick maturing crops and are harvested before they can affect the growth of the main crop.

Examples of catch crops are:

Lettuce\
Radish\
Spring Onions\
Rocket\
Spinach\
And mini or baby vegetables.
